# Robot Pollinator Game

Robot Pollinator Game is a fun and educational web-based SPA game where players control a robot pollinator to help pollinate flowers and earn points. The game is designed to teach about the importance of pollination in a fun and interactive way.
It was inspired by an (extremely cool! ) Arduino hardware project designed by my friend Fernando Mercado Fuertes and his niece for a school project.

## How to Play

1. **Move the Robot Pollinator:** Move your mouse cursor to control the robot pollinator. It will follow your cursor's movements.
2. **Collect Pollen:** Press the spacebar when near male flowers to collect their pollen.
3. **Pollinate Female Flowers:** Left-click to shoot the collected pollen at female flowers.
4. **Switch Pollen Colors:** Right-click to switch between the collected pollen colors.
5. **Score Points:** Match the pollen color to the female flower color to earn 100 points. Wrong color matches will deduct 100 points.
6. **Win Condition:** Reach 1000 points within 3 minutes to win the game.
