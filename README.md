# Robot Pollinator Game

Robot Pollinator Game is a fun and educational web-based SPA game where players control a robot pollinator to help pollinate flowers and earn points. The game is designed to teach about the importance of pollination in a fun and interactive way.
It was inspired by an (extremely cool! ) Arduino hardware project designed by my friend Fernando Mercado Fuertes and his niece for a school project.
